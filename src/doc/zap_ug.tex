\section{Introduction}

ZAP is a synthesizable open source 32-bit RISC processor core capable of 
executing ARMÂ®v4T binaries at both the user and supervisor level. The processor 
features a 10-stage pipeline that allows it to reach reasonable operating 
frequencies. The processor supports standard I/D cache and memory management 
that may be controlled using coprocessor \#15. Both the cache and TLB are direct 
mapped. Caches, TLBs and branch memory are implemented as generic fully 
synchronous RAMs that can efficiently map to native FPGA block RAM to save FPGA 
resources. To simplify  device integration, the memory bus is fully compliant 
with Wishbone B3. A store buffer is implemented to improve performance.

NOTE: Please use pipeline retiming during synthesis for maximum timing performance. 

\subsection{CPU Clock and Reset}
ZAP uses a single clock called the core clock to drive the entire design. The 
clock must be supplied to the port I\_CLK. ZAP expects a rising edge 
synchronous I\_RESET (active high) to be applied i.e., 
the reset signal must change only on the rising edges of clock. The reset 
must be externally synchronized to the core clock before being applied to 
the processor.

\subsection{Pipeline Overview}

\begin{tabularx} {\linewidth}{|r|X|}
\hline

Stage & 
Description \\ \hline 

Fetch & 
Clocks data from I-cache into instruction register. Also branch predictor memory 
is read out in this stage. \\ \hline 

FIFO &
Instructions and corresponding PC+8 values are clocked into a shallow buffer.
 \\ \hline

Thumb Decoder &
Converts 16-bit instructions to 32-bit ARM instructions. Instructions predicted 
as taken cause the pipeline to change to the new predicted target. \\ \hline

Predecode &
Handles coprocessor instructions, SWAP and LDM/STM. \\ \hline

Decode &
Decodes ARM instructions. \\ \hline

Issue &
Operand values are extracted here from the bypass network. In case data from 
the bypass network is not available, the register file is read. \\ \hline

Shift &
Performs shifts and multiplies. Contains a single level bypass network to 
optimize away certain dependencies. Multiplication takes multiple clock cycles. \\ \hline

Execute &
Contains the ALU. The ALU is single cycle and handles arithmetic and logical 
operations. \\ \hline

Memory &
Clocks data from the data cache into the pipeline. Aligns read data as 
necessary. \\ \hline

Writeback &
Writes to register file. Can sustain 2 writes per clock cycle although the 
only use for the feature is accelerate LDR performance in the current 
implementation. \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\\
\\
ZAP features a 10 stage pipeline. The pipeline has an extensive bypass network 
to minimize pipeline stalls. A load accelerator allows data to be forwarded 
from memory a cycle early. Most non-multiply instructions can be executed 
within a single clock tick with no stalls. Exceptions to this rule are when 
multiplies or non-trivial shifts are used.
\\
\\
The following code takes 3 cycles to execute because R1 needs to be shifted 
and is not available until the first instruction enters the ALU: 
\\
\\
ADD R1, R2, R3 \\
ADD R4, R5, R1 LSL R2 \\
\\
\\
If the second register is not source shifted by a register that depends on the 
previous instruction, a data dependency check may be relaxed (Register R9 for 
the second instruction can be obtained in issue itself so nothing is blocking 
the second instruction from using the shifter) and thus the following code 
takes 2 cycles to execute:
\\
\\
ADD R1, R2, R3 LSL R5 \\
ADD R4, R1, R9 LSL R2 \\
\\
\\
Another feature of the pipeline is that it can issue memory operations with 
writeback in a single cycle. The following instructions takes 2 cycles to 
execute assuming a perfect cache.
\\ 
\\
LDR R0, [R1, \#2]! \\
ADD R1, R3, R4 LSL R1 \\
\\
\\
The pipeline feedback unit is designed to reasonably minimize pipeline stalls. 
Note however that pipeline bubble squashing is available only  across the 
instruction FIFO.

\subsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fully synthesizable Verilog-2001 core.   
\item          Store buffer for improved performance.   
\item          Can execute ARMv4T code at both the user and supervisor level. 
\item          Wishbone B3 compatible interface. Cache unit supports burst access.
\item          10-stage pipeline design. Pipeline has bypass network to resolve 
               dependencies.
\item          2 write ports for the register file to allow LDR/STR with 
               writeback to execute as a single instruction. Note that the 
               register file is implemented using flip-flops.
\item          Branch prediction supported. Uses a 2-bit state for each branch.
\item          Split I and D writeback cache (Size can be configured using parameters).
\item          Split I and D MMUs (TLB size can be configured using parameters).
\item          Base restored abort model to simplify data abort handling.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Branch prediction mechanism}

ZAP uses a relatively simple branch prediction mechanism (Note that the branch 
table block RAM is read in Fetch). Note that when using ARM code, the amount of 
branch table entries is cut by half since the lower 2 bits of PC are 0. A 
simple state machine is used to reinforce or modify the status of a branch. The 
pass and fail signals are generated from the ALU.

\subsection{Cache/TLB Overview}

ZAP uses direct mapped cache (separate I/D) that is virtual. For decent 
performance, the cache is writeback. To enable writeback, each cache line has 
a dirty bit. The size of each cache line is fixed at 16 bytes. Since ARMv4 
specifies three kinds of paging schemes: section, large and small pages, 3 
TLB block RAMs are employed which are also direct mapped. ZAP has independent 
instruction and data caches/TLBs. The cache/MMU setup is v4 compatible. The 
cache should be enabled as soon as possible for good performance because the 
memory subsystem is efficient for burst transactions.

\subsection{Running Simulations}
\subsubsection{Creating and Simulating Test Cases}

To create a test case, create a some assembly(.s extension) and 
C files(.c extension) and a linker script(.ld extension) in the directory 
\texttt{src/ts/$\langle$TestCase$\rangle$/}
\\
\\
Copy the \texttt{makefile} and \texttt{Config.cfg} from one of the existing test case directories 
to the directory \texttt{src/ts/$\langle$TestCase$\rangle$/}. Edit the \texttt{Config.cfg} to suit the testcase.
\\
\\
To run simulations using the scripts provided, you will need Icarus 
Verilog 10.0 or higher and the ARM baremetal GCC toolchain. Object files and 
waveform dumps can be found in the \texttt{obj/ts/$\langle$TestCase$\rangle$/} directory.
\\
\\
Enter \texttt{src/ts/$\langle$TestCase$\rangle$} and type \texttt{make}.
\\
\\
NOTE: Normally C files are directly converted to object files. To view the assembly code for a C file (say file.c), do \texttt{make c2asm X=file.c}.
This will create a file called \texttt{file.c.asm} in the corresponding object directory.
\\
NOTE: To clean object files, enter \texttt{src/ts/$\langle$TestCase$\rangle$} and type \texttt{make clean}.
\\
NOTE: To clean object files and the extracted GCC files, enter \texttt{src/ts/$\langle$TestCase$\rangle$} and type \texttt{make cleanall}.
\\
\\
NOTE: You can set the testbench and processor configuration in the \texttt{Config.cfg} 
file that contains a Perl hash. This file is present in the same directory as 
the test case. 
\\
\\
Here's a sample of what the \texttt{Config.cfg} file should contain.

does not support high vectors ([13] reads 0) and always has a predictable cache 
strategy ([11] reads 1) i.e., direct mapped. \newline

3. Reads are UNPREDICTABLE. \newline

4. Only data MMU can update this. For debug purposes, these are RW registers. \newline
